As the interviews at IIT Bombay - Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management draws near, it's a fitting moment for me to reflect on the enriching journey I had in the past few months:

✨ <b>Academics</b>: The exceptional faculty here employs a case-study-based approach, fostering insightful discussions on business cases that elevate our learning experience.

✨ <b>Cultural</b>: Immerse yourself in the dynamic IIT Bombay ecosystem with active participation in events like Moodi, E-summit, and the tech fest. Within the SOM community, we've cultivated a vibrant cultural scene. Avenues, our business fest, stands as a testament to SOM-driven initiatives. Additionally, our Cultural Council and sports teams actively compete in inter-bschool events, creating a unique cultural identity within the SOM community.

✨ <b>Student Life</b>: While the initial months demand focus, the manageable workload allows for exploring diverse interests alongside academics. The campus's scenic beauty and a close-knit batch size (around 120) contribute to fostering strong bonds with every batchmate.

✨ <b>Entrepreneurship</b>: The entrepreneurial spirit thrives with multiple on-campus incubators, with the Society for Innovation & Entrepreneurship -SINE IIT Bombay at the forefront. SINE provides robust support for aspiring entrepreneurs, offering pitching forums, resources, and a nurturing environment for innovative ideas to flourish.

✨ <b>Clubs and Teams</b>: With a wide array of domain clubs and teams that take up various responsibilities within the college, there's almost an assurance that you will have something or the other to learn every other day as the clubs and teams try to come up with new activities every time!

Well! That's all I had to say! Best of luck for your interviews and sincerely looking forward to seeing you guys here and building more memories!
