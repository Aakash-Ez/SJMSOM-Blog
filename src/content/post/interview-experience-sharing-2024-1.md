This video features several students sharing their experiences with the SJMSOM interview process.

<b>Positive and Well-Organized Process:</b>

The students all describe their interview experiences as positive and well-organized. They emphasize the helpfulness of the PI Buddy program, where each interviewee is assigned a current student who has already gone through the process themselves. These PI Buddies provide guidance, support, and answer any questions throughout the preparation phase.

<b>Benefits of the PI Buddy Program:</b>

<b>The PI Buddy program offers several advantages:</b>

1. Preparation Guidance: PI Buddies offer valuable insights and advice on how to prepare for the interview.
2. Calming Nerves: Having a dedicated contact person helps to reduce pre-interview anxiety.
3. 24/7 Availability: Students highlight the convenience of having their PI Buddy available around the clock to address any doubts or last-minute questions, especially beneficial for working professionals.

<b>Streamlined Admissions Process:</b>

The video also details the streamlined admissions process at SJMSOM:

1. Application Form: The journey begins with submitting the application form.
2. PI Buddy Assignment: Once the application is received, students are assigned a PI Buddy.
3. Interview Preparation: With the help of their PI Buddy and provided resources, students prepare for the interview.
4. The Interview: The final stage involves the interview with the admissions committee.
Focus on Interview Content:

The video goes on to describe the interview itself. Students mention that the interview questions centered around their academic background, work experience (if applicable), and technical skills. They also emphasize the importance of thoroughly understanding one's profile and being well-prepared to answer questions about motivations for pursuing an MBA and future career goals.
