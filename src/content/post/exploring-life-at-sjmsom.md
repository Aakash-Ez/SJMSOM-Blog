With the MBA-admission fever on and after my last post on securing "Top 50 most promising MBA student - batch of 2025 by InsideIIM.com | AltUni.in , I have been getting lot of pings around MBA admission topic: from 'where to apply' to 'how to prepare'. 
However what caught my attention is the shift in the line of questioning from "IIT me MBA hota bhi hai" to "IIT Bombay ke MBA me kya kya hota hai".
Hence I decided to give you a sneak peek into the life at IIT Bombay - Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management .

<b>Ecosystem</b> ‚òØÔ∏è-
First up let's talk about the best part. SJMSOM and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in ways more than one are fully integrated. Imagine learning with students from 15+ Academic dept, 30+ centres of learning from nanotech to entrepreneurship, and hanging out with India's top design as well as management school students.
Synergies are endless here.

<b>Academics</b> üìö-
Latest pedagogy with some of country's best professors would want you to learn more. Whether you are interested in fin, sales & marketing, operations, tech management, international business we have courses for all and more.
Btw did I tell you former CXOs of National Stock Exchange, Maruti Suzuki and many others have been taking courses for us. 

<b>Infrastructure</b> üèòÔ∏è-
If you get up with a view of a lake amidst the hustle bustle of Mumbai, then trust me you are amidst the lucky few. With 18+ hostels, world class Gymkhana, great student activity centre, numerous food joints including a Cafe Coffee Day and Domino's, and what not, this 600 acre will steal your heart.

<b>Sports</b> üèÖ-
One genuine concern over sports in this campus is the confusion of which game to choose from, whether it's the courts, grounds or the pools, everything is state of the art here amidst IIT Bombay Sports community.
Oh Also, have you tried rock climbing here yet?

<b>Co curricular activities</b> üé∂-
Experiencing college fests are one thing but being part of organizing committees of some of Asia's largest festivals like Mood Indigo IIT Bombay, Techfest, IIT Bombay, or E-Cell, IIT Bombay's E-Summit are experiences you don't get every day. Be prepared to have a super busy schedule.


Honestly, this post will not be able to do justice to the fun we have at SJMSOM, and the only way to know about it is to experience it. 
Feel free to DM to discuss more on the endless opportunities here at SJMSOM and meanwhile have a look at a beautiful still from our campus captured by Tushar.

PS- you may say I am biased, but I would say SJMSOM teaches brand management well!!
