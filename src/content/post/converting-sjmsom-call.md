Converting IIT Bombay - Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management - My Interview Experience

Profile: 9/9/9 [B. Tech (CSE), VIT Chennai, 11 Month Workex in IT (Cloudera)]
CAT '22: 98.48 Percentile

My interview last year was scheduled on the 3rd of March Afternoon. Each table consisted of 10 interviewees and my number was around the middle.

Panelists: 1 <b>Faculty</b> and 2 Alumni from SJMSOM

Pre-Interview: Before the interview process we were assigned with a PI buddy who was a current student in SJMSOM as well as were provided with a PI Kit which dealt with the frequently asked questions in the various domains and good to know managerial terms in various sectors. Before the interview we met with our table buddy and they helped us calm down and walked us through what to expect.

The Actual Interview:

<b>Faculty</b>: Tell me about yourself.

<b>Me</b>: A brief introduction touch basing on my work experience, under graduation and background.

<b>Faculty</b>: Why MBA?

<b>Me</b>: Explained how I wanted to widen my understanding of business from beyond just technical perspective.

<b>Faculty</b>: Why SJMSOM specifically for MBA?

<b>Me</b>: Explained how the school's philosophy aligns with my techno managerial curiosities.

<b>P1</b>: (Discussions on the work projects and the business decisions that went behind it)

<b>P2</b>: (Discussion on books that I have read as it was my hobby and was asked to explain why I had chosen a certain book as my favorite)

<b>Faculty</b>: What's your opinion on open source technology?

<b>Me</b>: Brief discussion on open source as I had worked with FOSSEE IIT Bombay before

<b>Faculty</b>: Impact of Open Source technology and why companies invest in it?

<b>Me</b>: Went on the discuss the merits and demerits of open source technology and how innovation is often driven by these projects.

The interview as a whole lasted around 20 minutes and the questions were most related to what you had already provided them in the form or from your CV. I felt like they were more keen on gauging my interests and how well versed I am in the same.
